Enricher is a stream enriching engine based of Kafka Streams. Enricher does joins (streams and tables) end enrichment with any data store system that you define. You only need to define a JSON stream where you specify the joiners and enrichers to use and your enrichment query.

Enricher is the one of the components of Wizzie Workflow used by:

* **[Wizzie Data Platform: WDP](https://wizzie.io/what-is-wizzie/#platform)**
* **[Wizzie Community Stack: WCS](https://github.com/wizzie-io/community-stack)**
