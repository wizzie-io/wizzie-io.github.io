Widget is the basic visualization element at Wizz-Vis. It represent a KPI selecting Dimensions and Aggregators from a Datasource. The style and behavior could be modified with the built-in options from each widget.

This document is a guide to introduce the wide variety of widgets and will instruct the creation depending on the widget type and the data wants to be show.

## Attributes

Each widget has the below attributes. Some of them are optional attributes, depending on the widget's type. Each particularity will be referenced later in each widget's section.

* datasource_id [ID]
* dashboard_id [ID]
* title [String]
* row [Integer]
* col [Integer]
* size_x [Integer]
* size_y [Integer]
* type [String]
* range [String]
* start_time [DateTime]
* end_time [DateTime]
* granularity [String]
* limit [Integer]
* options [Hash/JSON]

Also, widgets have relations with other entities:

* dimensions [Array]
* aggregators [Array]
* post_aggregators [Array]
* filters [Array]

### datasource_id

`Required`

Association for the Druid's datasource.

### dashboard_id

`Required`

Association for the dashboard selected to contain the widget.

### row and col

`Required`

Represent the row and column of the widget in the dashboard that is contained.

### size_x and size_y

`Required`

These attributes represent the width and height of the widget in the dashboard that is contained.

Dashboard are grid based with 12 columns, so `size_x` has to be between 1 and 12.

### type

This attribute will determine the type of widget to be represented.

* [WidgetSerie](#widgetserie)
* [WidgetBar](#widgetbar)
* [WidgetPie](#widgetpie)
* [WidgetValue](#widgetvalue)
* [WidgetTable](#widgettable)
* [WidgetHeatmap](#widgetheatmap)
* [WidgetLocation](#widgetlocation)
* [WidgetPlaneLocation](#widgetplanelocation)
* [WidgetPlane](#widgetplane)
* [WidgetSankey](#widgetsankey)
* [WidgetChord](#widgetchord)
* [WidgetMultiserie](#widgetmultiserie)
* [WidgetRoute](#widgetroute)
* [WidgetPlaneRoute](#widgetplaneroute)
* [WidgetImage](#widgetimage)
* [WidgetHistogram](#widgethistogram)
* [WidgetText](#widgettext)

### range

This attribute is used to set the interval.

The possible values are:

* last_30_minutes
* last_1_hour
* last_6_hours
* last_1_day
* last_7_days
* last_30_days
* current_day
* current_week
* current_month
* previous_day
* previous_week
* previous_month

These are the predefined ranges. Also, we can use `last` ranges with the format `last_x_y`, where `x` should be a float number and `y` one of `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days`, `weeks` or `months`.

### start_time and end_time

Used to include a fixed interval.  If `range` is setted, these attributes are ignored.

The format used is:

`YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS`

For example:

`2016-11-04 18:55:00`

### granularity

The values allowed for granularity are:

* all
* minute
* fifteen_minute
* thirty_minute
* hour
* day

Also, granularity can be represented with period:

* PT1M
* PT15M
* PT30M
* PT1H
* P1D

Widgets which must have the granularity set to `all`, do not need to indicate the granularity at the time of creation.

If a widget with granularity other than `all` has no granularity setted, it will be assigned one related to the selected time interval. Otherwise, it will use its own granularity.

* PT1M: Less than or equal to one hour
* PT5M: From one to six hours
* PT1H: From six hours to one week
* P1D: From one week to three months
* P1W: From three months to one year
* P1M: More than one year

You have more information in Druid docs: [Aggregation Granularity](http://druid.io/docs/latest/querying/granularities.html){:target="_blank"}.

### limit

Some widgets need the limit `attribute` to restrict the number of elements to be returned.

By default, the limit will be `5`.

### options

This attribute is used to modify the style and behavior of some widgets. The content depends on the type of widget created.

For all widgets, we can specify an image or a background color as follows:

```json
{
  "background": {
    "image": "http://www.aerobusbcn.com/sites/default/media/fira2.jpg",
    "opacity": "0.3"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "background": {
    "color": "#ffff00" | "transparent"
  }
}
```

We will cover specific parameters later.

### dimensions

Each widget could represent one or more dimensions, depending on widget's type.

{% include warning.html content="Only dimensions that belong to the datasource selected could be used." %}

### aggregators

Each widget could represent one or more aggregator, depending on widget's type. Also, aggregators could be used to be referenced by post aggregators.

{% include warning.html content="Only aggregators that belong to the datasource selected could be used." %}

### post_aggregators

Various aggregators could be combined between them and make operations, resulting in a new metric to be used by the widget to be represented.

{% include warning.html content="The aggregators referenced by the post aggregators have to be included as aggregators themselves." %}

{% include tip.html content="If more than one aggregator or post aggregator has been defined, we can select which metric or metrics will be represented in the widget using the property `metrics` at `options` attribute.
For instance, if we have included as aggregators `flows` and `events` and then a post aggregator named `flows_per_event`, we can select that only the last one is represented." %}

### filters

Widget's data can be filter, indicating which rows of data should be included in the computation for a query. Itâ€™s essentially the equivalent of the WHERE clause in SQL. Wizz-vis supports the following types of filters:

* Equality
* Inequality
* Comparasion
* Regexp

## Widget Types

### WidgetSerie

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/serie_line.png" alt="Line Serie" caption="Line Serie Widget" %}
{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/serie_bar.png" alt="Bar Serie" caption="Bar Serie Widget" %}
{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/serie_area.png" alt="Area Serie" caption="Area Serie Widget" %}

This type of widget will represent timeseries, so the attributes necessaries, in addition to the required ones, are:

* granularity (one different to all)
* aggregators (at least one)

We can select between three types of chart. It can be configured through `options` attribute with one of these values:

* line
* area
* bar

```json
{
  "type": "area"
}
```

By default, if no value is provided, `line` will be used.

This widget also has the [compare](/wizz-vis_{{page.version}}_compare.html) and [threshold](/wizz-vis_{{page.version}}_thresholds.html) features available.

### WidgetBar

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/bar.png" alt="Bar Widget" %}

It will represent a TopN query. In addition to the required attributes, we have to set:

* dimensions (one)
* aggregators (one)
* limit

If more than one aggregator is set, only one will be represented (or a post aggregation that use these aggregators if necessary).

We can set the main color of the graph through the `options` attribute.

```json
{
  "color": "red" | "#ff0000"
}
```

This widget also has the [threshold](/wizz-vis_{{page.version}}_thresholds.html) feature available.

### WidgetPie

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/pie.png" alt="Pie Widget" %}

It will represent a TopN query. In addition to the required attributes, we have to set:

* dimensions (one)
* aggregators (one)
* limit

### WidgetValue

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/value_1.png" alt="Value Widget" %}
{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/value_2.png" alt="Value Widget" %}

It will represent a single value looking at the max, min, average of sum of values in the serie returned. Also, the serie and a gauge with thresholds could be represented in the widget.

In addition to the required attributes, we have to set:

* granularity
* aggregators (one)
* options

We can select between various ways of getting the value from the timeserie query that the widget made. It can be configured through `options` attribute with one of these values:

* current (last value returned in the serie)
* max
* min
* average
* total

By default, if no value is provided, `current` will be used.

```json
{
  "value": "average"
}
```

If we want to represent a gauge, options must be set as:

```ruby
{
  "gauge": {
    "show": true,
    "max": 500000,
    "thresholds": [
      [0.25, "#3DCC91"],
      [0.5, "#FFCC00"],
      [0.75, "#FFB366"],
      [1, "#FF7373"]
    ]
  }
}
```

If we want to represent the serie with a custom color, options must be set as:

```json
{
  "serie": {
    "show": true,
    "color": "yellow" | "#ffff00" (default: #3DCC91)
  }
}
```

This widget also has the [compare](/wizz-vis_{{page.version}}_compare.html) feature available.

### WidgetTable

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/table.png" alt="Table Widget" %}

It will represent a TopN or GroupBy query. In addition to the required attributes, we have to set:

* dimensions (at least one)
* aggregators (at least one)
* limit

This widget also has the [compare](/wizz-vis_{{page.version}}_compare.html) feature available.

If the table use more than one aggregator, we can select which ones use the compare feature through the `compare` option at `options` attribute:

```json
"compare": {
  "range": "previous_period",
  "aggregators": ["events"]
}
```

If the `aggregators` option is not included, all aggregators used in the table will show the compare info.

### WidgetHeatmap

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/heatmap.png" alt="Heatmap Widget" %}

* dimensions (one, representing coordinates)
* aggregators (one)
* limit

Also, we can set the visibility of the legend, or the size, color and behavior of each point through the `options` attribute.

```json
"options": {
  "legend": true | false, (default: true)
  "max_zoom": 15, (default: 1)
  "max_value": "max" | "average" | Number, (default: "max")
  "blur": 5, (default: 10)
  "radius": 15, (default: 20)
  "gradient": {
    "0.4": "blue", "0.6": "cyan", "0.7": "lime",
    "0.8": "yellow", "1.0": "red" (default colors)
  }
}
```

* `max_zoom`: maximum zoom for heatmap. For higher values of this zoom value, each point represents its maximum intensity.
* `max_value`: max intensity value for heatmap. This aggregation value will be represented in red and the rest of the colors will be calculated proportionally. Higher aggregation values will always be red. You can adjust it to the higher or lower aggregation value presented in the widget. By default, it assigns the max of the aggregation values of all the points.
* `blur`: blur for heatmap points.
* `radius`: radius for heatmap points.
* `gradient`: object defining gradient stop points for heatmap.

### WidgetLocation

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/location.png" alt="Location Widget" %}

There are two ways to represent this widget. One of them using the coordinates as a dimension and another one using the coordinates as a aggregator.

In the dimension way, we have to set, apart to the required attributes:

* dimensions (two or more, one representing [coordinates](#coordinates) and the others to tag the marker)
* aggregators (at least one)
* granularity (one different to `all`)
* limit

In the aggregator way, we have to set, apart to the required attributes:

* dimensions (at least one)
* aggregators (at least one, one representing [coordinates](#coordinates) as stringLast or stringFirst aggregator)
* granularity (`all`)
* limit

### WidgetPlaneLocation

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/plane_location.png" alt="Plane Location Widget" %}

Similar to WidgetLocation, but representing the markers over an image instead of a map.

There are two ways to represent this widget. One of them using the coordinates as a dimension and another one using the coordinates as a aggregator.

In the dimension way, we have to set, apart to the required attributes:

* dimensions (two or more, one representing [coordinates](#coordinates) and the others to tag the marker)
* aggregators (at least one)
* granularity (one different to `all`)
* limit

In the aggregator way, we have to set, apart to the required attributes:

* dimensions (at least one)
* aggregators (at least one, one representing [coordinates](#coordinates) as stringLast or stringFirst aggregator)
* granularity (`all`)
* limit

It needs GPS markers to convert the latitude-longitude data to x-y points. Al least, three gps markers have to be configured.

x-y points are references for a image point starting at top-left corner of the image.

To keep the proportions of the used image, we have to use `keep_ratio` property.

The `options` attribute would be as follows:

```json
{
  "image": "https://www.bookingtaxibarcelona.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fira-gran-via-map.png",
  "keep_ratio": true,
  "gps_markers": [
    { "x": 261, "y": 208, "latitude": 41.355151, "longitude": 2.127733 },
    { "x": 530, "y": 217, "latitude": 41.357172, "longitude": 2.130533 },
    { "x": 785, "y": 406, "latitude": 41.3559, "longitude": 2.138092 }
  ]
}
```

Also, the marker's color could be configured through thresholds. They can be configured with the `options` attribute.

```json
{
  "threshold_metric": "events",
  "thresholds": [
    [200, "#3DCC91"],
    [500, "#FFB366"],
    [900, "#FF7373"]
  ]
}
```

So, if the marker is above `500` but below `900` for the configured metric, it will have the color `#FFB366`.

If no `threshold_metric` is configured, it will use the first aggregator configured for the widget to calculate the marker's color.

### WidgetPlane

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/plane.png" alt="Plane Widget" %}

Similar to WidgetHeatmap, but representing the data over an image instead of a map.

* dimensions (one, representing coordinates)
* aggregators (one)
* limit

It needs GPS markers to convert the latitude-longitude data to x-y points. Al least, three gps markers have to be configured.

x-y points are references for a image point starting at top-left corner of the image.

To keep the proportions of the used image, we have to use `keep_ratio` property.

We can show or hide the legend through the `legend` property by setting it to true or false (default to true).

The `options` attribute would be as follows:

```json
{
  "max_value": "max" | "average" | Number, (default: "max")
  "opacity": 0.5, (default: 1)
  "radius": 15, (default: 40)
  "image": "https://www.bookingtaxibarcelona.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fira-gran-via-map.png",
  "keep_ratio": true,
  "gps_markers": [
    { "x": 261, "y": 208, "latitude": 41.355151, "longitude": 2.127733 },
    { "x": 530, "y": 217, "latitude": 41.357172, "longitude": 2.130533 },
    { "x": 785, "y": 406, "latitude": 41.3559, "longitude": 2.138092 }
  ],
  "legend": false
}
```

### WidgetSankey

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/sankey.png" alt="Sankey Widget" %}

It will represent a GroupBy query. In addition to the required attributes, we have to set:

* dimensions (two or more)
* aggregators (one)
* limit

The order of the dimensions is a bit random. So the order could be set in the options attribute:

```json
{
  "ordered_dimensions": ["src_ip", "protocol", "dst_ip"]
}
```

The name of dimensions at `ordered_dimensions` should be the same as those configured at dimensions relation.

### WidgetChord

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/chord.png" alt="Chord Widget" %}

It will represent a GroupBy query. In addition to the required attributes, we have to set:

* dimensions (two: origin and destination)
* aggregators (one)
* limit

The order of the dimensions is a bit random. So the origin and the destination to calculate the matrix values can be set in the options attribute. Also, we can set the legend option:

```json
{
  "legend": true,
  "origin": "src",
  "destination": "dst"
}
```

### WidgetMultiserie

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/multiserie.png" alt="Multiserie Widget" %}

It will represent a Timeserie query for each value obtained from a TopN query. In addition to the required attributes, we have to set:

* dimensions (one)
* aggregators (one)
* granularity (one different to `all`)
* limit

We can select between three types of chart. It can be configured through `options` attribute, setting the `type` property, with one of these values:

* line
* area
* bar

By default, if no value is provided, `line` will be used.

We can set the `stacked` property to true or false if we want the graphs to be stacked.

This widget also has the [threshold](/wizz-vis_{{page.version}}_thresholds.html) feature available.

`options` attribute example:

```json
{
  "type": "area",
  "stacked": true,
  "thresholds": [
    { "value": 200000000, "color": "red", "label": "Threshold 1" },
    { "value": 100000000, "color": "#000000", "label": "Threshold 2" }
  ]
}
```

### WidgetRoute

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/route.png" alt="Route Widget" %}

There are two ways to represent this widget. One of them using the coordinates as a dimension and another one using the coordinates as a aggregator.

In the dimension way, we have to set, apart to the required attributes:

* dimensions (two, one representing [coordinates](#coordinates) and another to represent the asset)
* aggregators (one)
* granularity (one different to `all`)
* limit

In the aggregator way, we have to set, apart to the required attributes:

* dimensions (one representing the asset)
* aggregators (one representing [coordinates](#coordinates) as stringLast or stringFirst aggregator)
* granularity (`all`)
* limit

We support three different routing profiles:

* driving
* walking
* cycling

By default, if no routing profile is selected, `driving` will be the one used.

Also, distance unit can be configured:

* km
* mi

By default, if no distance unit is selected, `km` will be the one used.

It can be set in the options attribute:

```json
{
  "routing_profile": "driving",
  "distance_unit": "mi"
}
```

### WidgetPlaneRoute

{% include image.html file="wizz-vis/widgets/plane_route.png" alt="Plane Route Widget" %}

There are two ways to represent this widget. One of them using the coordinates as a dimension and another one using the coordinates as a aggregator.

In the dimension way, we have to set, apart to the required attributes:

* dimensions (two, one representing [coordinates](#coordinates) and another to represent the asset)
* aggregators (one)
* granularity (one different to `all`)
* limit

In the aggregator way, we have to set, apart to the required attributes:

* dimensions (one representing the asset)
* aggregators (one representing [coordinates](#coordinates) as stringLast or stringFirst aggregator)
* granularity (`all`)
* limit

It needs GPS markers to convert the latitude-longitude data to x-y points. Al least, three gps markers have to be configured.

x-y points are references for a image point starting at top-left corner of the image.

To keep the proportions of the used image, we have to use `keep_ratio` property.

The `options` attribute would be as follows:

```json
{
  "image": "https://www.bookingtaxibarcelona.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fira-gran-via-map.png",
  "keep_ratio": true,
  "gps_markers": [
    { "x": 261, "y": 208, "latitude": 41.355151, "longitude": 2.127733 },
    { "x": 530, "y": 217, "latitude": 41.357172, "longitude": 2.130533 },
    { "x": 785, "y": 406, "latitude": 41.3559, "longitude": 2.138092 }
  ]
}
```

### WidgetImage

This is a special widget, because no Druid query will be done. However, required attributes have to be set.

Also, the attributes that can be configured using `options` field are:

```json
{
  "image": "https://www.bookingtaxibarcelona.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/fira-gran-via-map.png",
  "keep_ratio": true,
  "opacity": "1",
  "image-link": {
    "url": "/dashboards/43",
    "type": "dashboard"
  }
}
```

To keep the proportions of the used image, we have to use `keep_ratio` property.

A link could be associated to the image. When clicking, it will open the `url`, that could be an external resource (`"type": "absolute"`) or a dashboard link (`"type": "dashboard"`). You can redirect to the previous page by setting the property `url` to `back` (`"url": "back"`).

### WidgetHistogram

It will represent a Timeseries query. This widget will use a histrogram aggregation.

It will have two ways of representation:

* Representation of result fetched from Druid.
* Each value will discard the value of the previous section.

In addition to the required attributes, we have to set:

* aggregators (one)
* limit

We can set the optional discard values option by specifying a value between `previous` or `next`:

```json
"options": {
  "discard_values": "previous" | "next"
}
```

We use the widget limit attribute to specify the numBuckets. And the default value for the histogram type is 'equalBuckets', so to configure numBuckets we'll only need:

```json
"limit": 5,
"options": {
  "discard_values": "previous" | "next",
  "histogram": {}
}
```

To configure customBuckets through options:

```json
"limit": 4,
"options": {
  "discard_values": "previous" | "next",
  "histogram": {
    "type": "customBuckets",
    "breaks": [2, 150, 200, 3000, 5000]
  }
}
```

This widget also has the [threshold](/wizz-vis_{{page.version}}_thresholds.html) feature available.

### WidgetText

This is a special widget, because no Druid query will be done. However, required attributes have to be set.

Also, the attributes that can be configured using options field are:

```json
"options": {
  "text": "Your text",
  "fontSize": "42px"
}
```

## Misc

### Overwrite Interval

Each widget could overwrite the global time interval set for the dashboard, using the attributes `range` or `start_time` and `end_time`. In that case, the widget will show, at the right of the title, the interval used.

This information could be hidden through the options:

```json
{
  "showOverrideInterval": true | false
}

```

By default, the information will be shown.

### Coordinates

The dimensions and aggregators could represent coordinates in the format `latitude,longitude`, i.e. `37.3509227,-6.0607913`. They have to be named using the regexp `/coordinate|latlong|latlng/`.
