## Overview

This section shows the [Workflow Package](./wdp_1.0.X_workflow_package.html) Management. It allows to download, upload and delete the Workflow Packages by organization.

At the bottom of the organization main page, we can see this section:

## Operations

Using the interface, you can do the different operations:

### UPLOAD

Using the `+`, you can select a [workflow_package.tar.gz](./wdp_1.0.X_workflow_package.html) and upload to the platform.

{% include note.html content="The Workflow Package adds/updates WDP stack resources of the organization where it is uploaded. This action doesn't remove resources created before." %}

After `UPLOAD` is performed, it returns a message where you can see which stack resources are created/updated or if something went wrong.

### DOWNLOAD

Creates a new workflow_package.tar.gz file with the current stack resources status of the related organization and downloads it.

### DELETE

Removes every current stack resource of this organization.

{% include warning.html content="When you `DELETE` the current workflow, you remove all stack resource to this organization. Maybe, remove live data, indexers, configurations!" %}
