You can send JSON data over kafka using `prozzie kafka produce` command, and check proper reception with `prozzie kafka consume`.

Produce a valid JSON message is command user's responsibility; the command will not check that.

For more details please see the [CLI](../cli/CLI) documentation.

You can also send JSON data over kafka using in-prozzie embedded kafka producer
directly (or similar kafka client) to port 9092, and make sure to use the
previously exported IP address in prozzie installation to consume from kafka:

```bash
prozzie kafka produce testtopic
```

You can check that prozzie kafka receives the message with:

```bash
prozzie kafka consume testtopic
```

If you don't have them installed, you can run the kafka producer and consumer
integrated in prozzie with
`prozzie compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-{producer,consumer}.sh`

Since prozzie will convert all messages to kafka protocol, you can use the
previous command to check that prozzie is receiving them and how.

The default configured value of `log.retention.bytes` is up to 1GB by topic partition and `log.segment.bytes` is up to 512MB.
